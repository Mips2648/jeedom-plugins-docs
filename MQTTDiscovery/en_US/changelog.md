# Stable

## 2024-12-26

- Support of *Climate* / *HVAC* type
- Added "schema json" support for the *light* type: supports bulbs with brightness variation, color temperature, color selection, effects, transitions.
- Add **Status**, **On** and **Off** commands to the *light* type using the *default schema*.
- Fix on info commands for type *vacuum*.

## 2024-07-02

- Adding the *vacuum* type
- Fixed a problem with some device images not being displayed
- Update dependencies

## 2024-05-14

- Improved: creation of equipment commands after addition is immediate, no need to restart the daemon
- Improvement: last module name taken into account during discovery (useful if the name is changed after inclusion, for example).
- Improved: images of all zigbee modules (zigbee2mqtt compatible) will be automatically retrieved by the plugin.
- Add a button to open the module configuration if the url is provided in the discovery information (e.g. to the module config on zigbee2mqtt, to omg)
- fix of *update* type for zigbee devices (via zigbee2mqtt)
- Fix of type *device_automation* / *device trigger*; it is necessary to delete the corresponding commands and restart the daemon to recreate them correctly.
- Fix on dependencies check
- Update dependencies
- Internal modification of daemon

## 2024-02-25

- Optimizing the size of backups
- Add of the image of some zigbee modules

## 2024-02-14

- *select* type support (action/list command)
- *device_automation* type support
- *music_player* type support (to support sonos2mqtt gateway)
- Add **Open**, **Close** and **Stop** commands to the *cover* type (shutter, blind, curtain...).
- Improvement: command info whose unit is `%` will have their minimum and maximum values set to 0 and 100 by default.
- Add image for zigbee modules *Sonoff occupancy sensor (SNZB-06P)* and *Aqara curtain driver E1 (ZNCLBL01LM)*.
- Add a button to purge all discovered devices from the list and from the MQTT broker (not created devices, of course).
- Add a button to remove unknown devices from the list
- Removal of the “Duplicate” device button that had no reason to exist
- New version of the dependencies (paho-mqtt 2.0) and adaptation of the daemon accordingly
- Fix on discovering a *Lock* component when it has no defined name
- Fix action on*cover* on some devices

## 2023-12-09

- Reduce unnecessary logs
- Add button to permanently delete discovered device, including on the MQTT broker
- Fix: some “off” commands did not work properly because their configuration was saved incorrectly (this depended on the payload of the command)
- Add images of different devices models
- Add the default generic type configuration on the command (when possible)
- Add the update of the status of the battery of the device in the core (when possible)
- Add default icons on commands based on the generic type
- Add the possibility of managing presence on Bluetooth devices that are not decoded (and therefore not visible in discovered devices)
- Add the possibility to define a custom model name and therefore a custom image for each device (after changing the name of the device model)
- Fix: update the temperature info commands for Bluetooth device when the command was discovered by OMG (if discovered by Theengs Gateway it worked correctly)

## 2023-11-07

- Support *lock* type for lock management (e.g. Nuki)
- Add a default image for the Nuki Smart Lock 3.0 Pro
- Filters the types of files accepted by the plugin when selecting an image to send for a device model
- Fix on the “Configuration” button in the discovered devices screen

## 2023-11-02

- Improvement in the parsing of configurations for certain device (support for the “base topic” if declared)
- Change in presence management: **rssi** commands will be forced to -200 if no more update of the command (after the configured time limit)

## 2023-10-22

- Setting the min & max for **rssi** commands

## 2023-10-19

- Logs reorganization
- Minor fix on the creation process during automatic discovery

## 2023-10-18

- Add a **rssi** command by gateway providing the info. The main **rssi** command maintains the current behavior: it is the last value received on all antennas and presence management is based on this value
- Internal reorganization of the code which should be completely transparent

## 2023-10-16

- Added a button in the device configuration page to see the raw configuration of the device as well as a button to easily copy it to share it with me if necessary
- Reorganization of plugin data: in principle the custom images have been moved to the desired location, if not, please create a post on Community

## 2023-10-15

- Behavior change for the *cover* type (panes for example): creation of open/close/stop commands even if there is no status feedback
- Change the visibility and the default template on creation of some commands

## 2023-10-14

- Support for the type *update* which allows you to have info commands **Installed version**, **Latest version** and a **Firmware Update** action command to start updating the hardware for devices supporting this feature (for example OMG)

## 2023-10-12

- *device_tracker* support for compatibility with “Tiles”
- Add filters to the manual addition of device window to allow searching

## 2023-10-10

- Add possibility of having custom images on devices (one image per model)

## 2023-10-07

- Add the identifier, manufacturer and model of the device in the configuration page
- Addition of a new function listing all devices discovered but not yet created, with the possibility of adding them one by one to without having to activate automatic creation
- Add a notification on the device page when new device has been discovered
- Fix a parsing bug on some devices

## 2023-09-30

- Add a configuration to disable the automatic creation of discovered devices
- Add the *alarm_control_panel* type

## 2023-09-11

- *MQTT Manager (mqtt2)* is no longer a prerequisite (you must have an mqtt broker installed, either by you or via any other Jeedom plugin). If *MQTT Manager (mqtt2)* is installed, the broker configuration is semi-automatic.
- Implementation of an MQTT client dedicated to the plugin to improve performance and flexibility; the plugin now has a daemon
- Add the *cover* type
- Modification & improvement of the plugin configuration page

## 2023-09-07

- Fix on light/brightness

## 2023-07-20
