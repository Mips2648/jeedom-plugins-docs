# Description

Plugin to create a gateway between modbus TCP/IP and MQTT.

# Supported versions

| Component | Version                     |
|-----------|-----------------------------|
| Debian    | Bullseye(11) & Bookworm(12) |
| Jeedom    | >= 4.4                      |

# Installation

In order to use the plugin, you must download, install and activate it like any Jeedom plugin.
This plugin requires the *MQTT Manager (MQTT2)* plugin to work.

# Plugin configuration

Before starting, make sure you have installed and configured the *MQTT Manager (MQTT2)* plugin, see plugin documentation.

In the plugin configuration page, you can change the following options:

- The base topic under which the plugin will publish the information (see device configuration). By default the plugin will publish under the topic *modbus2mqtt*; you don't need to modify if it suits you
- The listening port of the plugin daemon. Only change this value if you understand how it works and only if you have a conflict with another plugin.

# Devices configuration

The plugin can be found in the Plugins → Home automation protocol menu.

After creating new device, the usual options are available.

Each device corresponds to a gateway composed of a modbus client and a MQTT client. The device will therefore connect to the modbus device configured to read and write the defined registers and will connect to your MQTT broker to publish and receive the corresponding messages.

On top of the general parameters, it will therefore be necessary to configure the specific parameters for the modbus connection as well as the MQTT topic for this device.

## Modbus connection settings

- *IP* and *Port* of your modbus TCP device
- *Refresh*: delay in seconds between each read/write operation on the modbus device
- *Offset* This offset is applied to every register address.
- *Batch*: number of contiguous registers to read during each read operation (between 1 and 100 inclusive). If 1 then each register will be read separately.
- *Word order*: Only for 32-bit or 64-bit numbers, choose between *Big-Endian* (the default) and *Little-Endian*

## MQTT settings

Only one element to configure, the topic of this device.

It will be a sub-topic of the general plugin topic (see plugin configuration) and each modbus register will be published in a sub-topic of this topic.

Example: if you have modbus device that we will call *solar* which allows you to obtain the power produced that we will call *power*, the information will be published in the topic *modbus2mqtt/solar/power*

## Modbus registers definition

In the second tab, *Registers*, you will have to configure the modbus registers that interest you and their MQTT correspondence.
Example:
![Modbus register](../images/modbus_register.png "Modbus register")
So you need to specify:

- the address
- the register table
- the type: signed or unsigned integer on 16 bits, 32 bits or 64 bits.
- Scale: the read value will be multiplied by this value before being published
- the MQTT topic for publishing the value (so modbus -> MQTT)
- option *Only if change* allows to publish on MQTT only if the value has changed, if unchecked the value will be published after each read operation
- *Retain* option to publish with *retain* flag or not
- possibly the writing topic: any info published on this topic will be written on the corresponding modbus register (thus MQTT -> modbus); typically if necessary you can put `power\set` or `power_set` for example.

## Commands creation

You can now save your device; the plugin will create the commands corresponding to your configuration and you will therefore be able to obtain the values ​​directly on these commands, they will be updated with each new publication and are therefore directly usable everywhere under Jeedom.

It is therefore not necessary to configure another MQTT device to obtain the values, however you are free to do so or to consume the MQTT topics from another device, another platform...

The commands are visible in the 3rd tab and you will find the usual configuration options there.
You should check and if necessary change the subtype of the info commands (numeric or binary) to match the registry definition.

If you have configured a topic to be able to write a value in a register, a corresponding action/message command will also be created, this command can be used directly everywhere in Jeedom as well.

# Support

If you have a problem, start by reading the latest plugin-related topics on [community]({{site.forum}}/tag/plugin-{{page.pluginId}}).

If despite this you do not find an answer to your question, do not hesitate to create a new topic, with the tag of the plugin ([plugin-{{page.pluginId}}]({{site.forum}}/tag/plugin-{{page.pluginId}})).

At a minimum, you will need to provide:

- a screenshot of the Jeedom health page
- a screenshot of the plugin's configuration page
- all available plugin logs pasted into a `Preformatted Text` (button `</>` on community), no files!
- depending on the case, a screenshot of the error encountered, a screenshot of the configuration causing the problem...
