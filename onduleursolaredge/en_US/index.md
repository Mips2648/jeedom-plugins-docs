In the plugin configuration, it is possible to provide commands to get sunrise and sunset time as provided by the *Weather* or *HÃ©liotrope* plugin. This will allow to pause the task that get data between those time as there isn't any solar energy production overnight ;-). If no command is provided, the task will run all day, from midnight to 23h59. You can also specify hard-coded value, format hhmm, e.g. 400 for 4h00 and 2200 for 22h00

# Configuration

## Solaredge API access activation

> **Important**
>
> The procedure below is no longer valid. SolarEdge has modified their monitoring site and the menus are different. Please contact their support to ask for the procedure to obtain an API key. This documentation will be updated as soon as the procedure is known.

## Creating the device in Jeedom

- Navigate to devices management available under menu "Plugins", "Energy" and "Solaredge".
- Click "Add" and choose a name.
- You will land on the configuration of your newly created device on witch you can setup usual Jeedom options (don't forget to activate your new device).

> **Important**
>
> You need to provide the API key and Site ID previously obtained from Solaredge monitoring platform.

Then choose the type of information you want. If you want more than one just create a second device with the same site ID and same API key.

Finally, select refresh frequency of the device. Following options exist:

- automatic: the frequency is dynamically calculated depending sunrise and sunset configuration to optimize the refresh without doing more requests than allowed by Solaredge
- manual: you choose the frequency but the plugin will not accept a value below the minimum displayed
- disabled

> **Important**
>
> Solaredge allow only 300 calls/day on their API; refreshing data every 5 minutes during 24 hours will trigger 288 calls (so below the limit of 300 calls). If you decide to manage the refresh with another mean, take care to not bypass this limit.
